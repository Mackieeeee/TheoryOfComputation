<h1>Introduction of Finite Automata</h1>
<p>Finite Automata(FA) is the simplest machine to recognize patterns. The finite <br> automata or finite state machine is an abstract machine that has five elements or <br> tuples. It has a set of states and rules for moving from one state to another but it <br> depends upon the applied input symbol. Basically, it is an abstract model of a digital <br> computer. The following figure shows some essential features of general <br> automation.</p><br>

<p>The above figure shows the following features of automata: <br>

    1.Input <br>
    2.Output <br>
    3.States of automata <br>
    4.State relation <br>
    5.Output relation <br><br>
    A Finite Automata consists of the following: <br><br>
    <div class="box">
    Q : Finite set of states. <br>
    Σ : set of Input Symbols. <br>
    q : Initial state. <br>
    F : set of Final States. <br>
    δ : Transition Function.</p> <br></div>
    <p>Formal specification of machine is </p>
    <div class="box">
    <p>{ Q, Σ, q, F, δ }</p>
    </div>

    <p>FA is characterized into two types: </p>
    <h2>1) Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA):</h2>
    <p>
<div class="box">DFA consists of 5 tuples {Q, Σ, q, F, δ}. 
Q : set of all states.<br><br>
Σ : set of input symbols. ( Symbols which machine takes as input )<br><br>
q : Initial state. ( Starting state of a machine )<br><br>
F : set of final state.<br><br>
δ : Transition Function, defined as δ : Q X Σ --> Q.</div><br><br>

    </p>
<p>
    In a DFA, for a particular input character, the machine goes to one state only.<br>     
     A transition function is defined on every state for every input symbol<br>
     Also in DFA null (or ε) move is not allowed, i.e., DFA cannot change state without any input character. <br>
     For example, below DFA with Σ = {0, 1} accepts all strings ending with 0. <br>
</p>
<img src="pictures/wfghh.jpg" alt="">
<p>
    One important thing to note is, in NFA, if any path for an input string leads to a final state,<br>
    For example, in the above NFA, there are multiple paths for the input string “00”. <br>
    Since one of the paths leads to a final state, “00” is accepted by the above NFA. <br>

</p>
<h3>Some Important Points:</h3>
<h2>Justification:</h2>
<p>Since all the tuples in DFA and NFA are the same except for one of the tuples, which is Transition Function (δ) <br>
    In case of DFA<br>
    δ : Q X Σ --> Q<br>
    In case of NFA<br>
    δ : Q X Σ --> 2Q<br>
    Now if you observe you’ll find out Q X Σ –> Q is part of Q X Σ –> 2Q.<br><br>

    On the RHS, Q is a subset of 2Q, implying that Q is included in 2Q or is a component of 2Q,<br>
    while the opposite is not true. So, mathematically, we can deduce that every DFA is an NFA but not the other way around. <br>
    However, because an NFA may be converted to a DFA, every NFA has a corresponding DFA.<br>

</p>
<p>1. Both NFA and DFA have the same power and each NFA can be translated into a DFA. <br>
    2.There can be multiple final states in both DFA and NFA. <br>
    3.NFA is more of a theoretical concept. <br>
    4.DFA is used in Lexical Analysis in Compiler. <br>
    5.If the number of states in the NFA is N then, its DFA can have maximum 2N number of states.<br><br>
